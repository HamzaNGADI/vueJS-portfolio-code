# Portfolio

The current portfolio website is intended for the global presentation of my profile, as well as the projects I've developed during my university studies or through self-study. The full or partial source code of these projects is available on GitHub.

The website is developed with the Vue.js framework, built and deployed with Vue-CLI, including Tailwind CSS for styling and design, and Font Awesome for icon display.
